"""
Battleships is a game played on a rectangular board.
Your are given a representation of such a board of size N(height)xM(width) with information about the locations of the ships.
The board is given as an array B, whose every element is a string that corresponds to one row of the game board.
Each character of each string represents a cell of the board and is eigher:
* a '#' character, marking a part of a ship; or
* a '-' character, representing an empty cell.
Two cells that share a side and have a value of # are parts of the same ship.
Cell(X, Y) shares a side with cells(X,Y-1), (X,Y+1), (X-1, Y) and (X+1, Y)
In the Battleships game there are three types of ships:
Patrol Boats of size=1
Submarines of size=2, which come in two shapes:
Destroyers of size=3, which come in six shapes:
Your tasks is to find the number of ships of each type occurring on the board
For example, on the board represented by B=[".##.#", "#.#..", "#...#", "#.##."],
there are two patrol boats(marked on the image below as 'P'), one submarine('S') and two destroyers('D').
Write a function:
    def solution(B):
that, given an array B consisting of N strings of length M each, returns an array R of three integers, such that:
* R[0] represents the number of Patrol Boats,
* R[1] represents the number of Submarines,
* R[2] represnets the number of Destroyers
Examples:
    1. Given B=[".##.#", "#.#..", #..#", "#.##."], the function should return [2,1,2] as explained above.
    2. Given B = [".#..#", "##..#", "...#."], the function should return [1,1,1]
    3. Given B= ["##.", "#.#", ".##"], the function should return [0,0,2]
    4. Given B= [".#..#", "##..#", "...#."], the function should return [1,1,1].
    5. Given B = ["##.","#.#", ".##"], the function should return [0,0,2].
    6. Given B = ["...", "...", "..."], the function should return [0,0,0].
Assume that:
*   N is an integer within the range[1..100]
*   All strings in B are of the same length M from the range[1..100]
*   Every string in B consists only of the following characters: "." and/or "#"
*   Every ship on the board is either a Boat(size 1), a Submarine(size 2) or a Destroyer(size 3)
In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
