"""
There ae N hospitals, numbered from 0 to N-1. You are given a schedule of work in each of the hospitals for the following M days. 
The schedule is provided in the form of a two-dimensional array A containing N rows, 
each row representing the schedule of one hospital, and M columns, each column representing one day.
Integer A[K][L] (for K within the range[0..N-1] and L within the range [0-M-1]) represents the ID of the doctor working at hospital K on day L. 
Note that sometimes an individual doctor may work at more than one hospital even on the same day.
Write a function:
  def solution(A)
that, given a martix A consisting of N rows and M columns represeting the hispitals' schedules, 
finds the number of doctors working at more than one hospital.
Examples:
1. Given A=[[1,2,2],[3,1,4]], the function should return 1.
The doctor with ID 1 works at both hospitals. 
The doctor with ID2 works only at hospital number 0, while the doctors with IDs 3 and 4 work only a hospital number 1.
2. Given A=[[1,1,5,2,3],[4,5,6,4,3],[9,4,4,1,5]], the function should return 4.
The doctors with IDs 1,3,4, and 5 work at more than one hospital.
3. Given A=[[4,3],[5,5],[6,2]], the function should return 0.
Each doctor works only at one hospital.
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
* N and M are integers within the range[1..1,000];
* each element of matrix A is an integer within the range[1..N*M]
